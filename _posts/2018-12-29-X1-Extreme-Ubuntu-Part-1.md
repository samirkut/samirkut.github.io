title: X1 Extreme on Ubuntu (Part 1)

I recently acquired an X1 Extreme and spent the last day or so getting Ubuntu (to be more accurate Pop OS) to play nice with it. I have documented them below partly for my own sanity and also to ensure that any other owners can use this as a starting point.

## BIOS changes

1. Turn off secure boot. 
_From what I have read it should be able to get Pop OS and secure boot to play nice but for now I am going to simply skip this._

2. Switch the Fn Key mode so that pressing F1-F12 keys does not require the Fn key pressed. 


## Installation
- Using Pop OS 18.10 amd64 nvidia edition. Refer to https://system76.com/pop
